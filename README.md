# Hi. I'm Evan ðŸ‘‹
My name is Evan Wong. I'm a recent graduate from Dickinson College, with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Chinese. Throughout my journey in this field, I've been particularly drawn towards data science & engineering, database management, full-stack development, software engineering, game design, and artificial intelligence.
